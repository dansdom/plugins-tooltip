Tooltip Plugin options and revisions

Settings:
toolID   - string;    This is the custom ID for the tool tip. Used to create different styles for each tooltip on the page
offsetY  - integer;   This is the vertical offest of the tooltip from the mouse position
offsetX  - integer;   This is the horizontal offest of the tooltip from the mouse position
domNode  - boolean;   If true then it will look for a DOM node to inject into the tooltip
ajax     - boolean;   If true then it will look for an external resource and inject that content into the tooltip
